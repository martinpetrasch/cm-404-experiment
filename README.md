2D Physics Experiment
====================

This was initially created to test a 2d physics solver ([box2d.js](http://sourceforge.net/projects/box2d-js/files/)) in the context of an existing 404 error page 
from [CargoMedia](https://github.com/cargomedia/cargomedia.github.io).

Based on "[Google Gravity](http://www.mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google-gravity/)" by Mr. doob.
