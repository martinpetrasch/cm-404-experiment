404 2d physics experiment
====================

This was initially created to test a 2d physics solver (box2d.js) in the context of an existing 404 error page from [CargoMedia](https://github.com/cargomedia/cargomedia.github.io).

This is based on "[Google Gravity](http://www.mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google-gravity/)" by Mr. doob.
